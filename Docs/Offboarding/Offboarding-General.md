### Always provide an option to delete the account.

Users choose to delete their account because as they won’t return to the site in the future, won't use the product anymore or want all their data deleted.

Deleting an account, unlike cancelling a membership or deactivating an account, is a permanent action. It should remove all user data, account details and security information
from the system.
