### Do not send a confirmation email after removing a the user from an email list.

It is important to send email notification on important operations and security events. However, when a user unsubuscribes from a mailing list, they expect the operation
to be executed.

Users either don't care or won't appreciate a confirmation. Sending a confirmation email after a user requests a cancelation so they don't receive anymore emails is not recommended.
