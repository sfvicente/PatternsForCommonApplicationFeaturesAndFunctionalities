### Use URLs as short as possible, aiming for no more than 50-60 characters.

In an extensive study[1] performed on around one million Google search results, it was concluded that shorter URLs tend to rank slightly better than long URLs.

The top sites have shorter URLs with an aproximate lenght of 50 characters. As testing progresses further down the list, the average URL length increases to 62 characters.

### Use hyphens to separate words in a URL.

In case a URL fragment is composed of more than one word, use hyphens to separate the words. These will assist search engines in determining where the breaks
between words are located. It will also make it easier for users to identify the meaning of the URLs.

### Do not include stop words in URLs.

Remove words such as pronouns and articles. Common stop words to avoid are "a", "the", "and", "or", "but", "an" and "of".
