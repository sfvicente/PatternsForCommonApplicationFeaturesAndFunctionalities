### Use URLs as short as possible, aiming for no more than 50-60 characters.

In an extensive study[1] performed on around one million Google search results, it was concluded that shorter URLs tend to rank slightly better than long URLs.

The top sites have shorter URLs with an aproximate lenght of 50 characters. As testing progresses further down the list, the average URL length increases to 62 characters.

### Do not include unsafe characters in URLs.

The following charactes are considered unsafe and should not be used in URL: blank/empty space and " < > # % { } | \ ^ ~ [ ] `

todo: explain each character.

All unsafe characters require enconding to be used within a URL.

### Use hyphens to separate words in a URL.

In case a URL fragment is composed of more than one word, use hyphens to separate the words. These will assist search engines in determining where the breaks
between words are located. It will also make it easier for users to identify the meaning of the URLs.

 Do not use underscores instead of hyphens to separate words. Google directly recommends that words be separated by hypehns instead of underscores.

### Use lowercase letters for URLs.

Using uppercase letters can lead to 404 and redirect errors on case-sensitive servers.

### Do not include stop words in URLs.

Common stop words to avoid are "a", "the", "and", "or", "but", "an" and "of".

Stop words are ignored by search engines and do not contribute to the ranking for the resource. URLs should not contain words such as pronouns and articles.

If the URL is readable without requiring stop words, including them will only increase the URL size, which might have an impact on the ranking. However, if the meaning and
content of the resource would become easier to identify by including an additional pronoun or article, then it should be included.

### Structure URLs for maximum readability.

Developers and creators should strive to create URLs that easily allow users and search engines to identify or deduce what the destination is and what it contains.

### Use a maximum depth of two folders per URL.

The following URL uses a folder depth of two:

Increased folder depth increases complexity or perceived complexity of the organisation of the application on the server. Search engines can associate this complexity to
content being too specific or unimportant.
