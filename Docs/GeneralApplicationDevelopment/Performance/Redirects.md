# Performance | Redirects

URL redirection, also called URL forwarding, is an internet technique for making a web page available under more than one URL address. When a web browser attempts to open
a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened.

Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL domain are redirected to a different domain. For example, when the domains such as
`www.mydomain.net` and `www.mydomain.org` are automatically redirected to `www.mydomain.com`.

The three most commonly used types of redirects are permanent (301), temporary (302), and Meta Refresh.
