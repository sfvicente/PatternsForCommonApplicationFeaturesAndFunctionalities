## Images

### Avoid setting `alt` text greater than 250 characters.

Alternative text needs to be brief.

### Always use `alt` text to convey the purpose of the image, not describe the image.

The alternative text should clearly indicate the meaning of the image.

An image can be used multiple times and have different meanings depending on the context in which it is being used.
