# Form Validation | General

<br>


### Consider assisting the user filling a form element by providing additional information.

For fields with specific requirements or restrictions, the application may assist the user by providing additional information about the field. This can be performed using descriptive
labels, tooltips, hints or icons.

### Do not display validation results of fields or forms in a modal dialog or popups.

By display errors in modal dialogs or popups, you shift the user focus between UI components.
