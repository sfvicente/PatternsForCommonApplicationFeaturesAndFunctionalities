# Form Validation | General

Form validation is the process of verifying the correctness and conformity of the information entered in form fields according to the predefined rules for the data.

### Consider assisting the user filling a form element by providing additional information.

For fields with specific requirements or restrictions, the application may assist the user by providing additional information about the field. This can be performed using descriptive
labels, tooltips, hints or icons.

### Prefer inline validation to validation on form submit.

When using inline validation, messages are displayed immediately after the user fills a form field. In the case of validation on form submit, the user has to provide all neccessary
information and then normally pushes a button to submits the data. Validation is then performed to all the fields either on the client or the server.

Inline validation is prefered because it decreases form completion time, the number of eye fixations and the errors performed.

### Inform users when validation fails so they perform immediate verification and correction before proceeding to the next step.

It not only helps the flow of filling the form but it also builds user confidence and positive expectation of a successful form completion.

### Do not display validation results of fields or forms in a modal dialog or popups.

By display errors in modal dialogs or popups, you shift the user focus between UI components.
