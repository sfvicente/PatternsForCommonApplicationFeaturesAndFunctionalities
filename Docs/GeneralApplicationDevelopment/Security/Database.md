### Always remove any history and troubleshooting files generated by the database install procedure.

Files that are written to disk when performing the installation of database servers should be deleted after the process has concluded successfully. Although usefull
for troubleshooting failed installs, history and debug files are not longer needed after installation is completed. It can provide information such as hardware, server
application or network connections to malicious users.

### Avoid storing confidential information in databases that are not required.

When a database is compromised and data is stolen, malicious agents can only access what is inside the database. By storing the least amount of confidential information
in the database, we reduce the value of the stored data and minimize the impact of the breach.

If information is not required for correct applications functioning, do not store it in the database.

### Always actively manage database content to delete any data that is no longer needed.

Any data that is no longer relevant or necessary should be archived or deleted. Removing or moving the data out of the store will decrease the value of the information
on the database and optimize space.

### Always move data that only needs to be retained for compliance to a separate storage.

Moving compliance information to another store or an offline medium makes the database less susceptible to attacks.
