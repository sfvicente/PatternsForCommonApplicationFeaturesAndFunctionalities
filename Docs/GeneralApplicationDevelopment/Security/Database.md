### Avoid storing confidential information in databases that are not required.

When a database is compromised and data is stolen, malicious agents can only access what is inside the database. By storing the least amount of confidential information
in the database, we reduce the value of the stored data and minimize the impact of the breach.

If information is not required for correct applications functioning, do not store it in the database.

### Always actively manage database content to delete any data that is no longer needed.

Any data that is no longer relevant or necessary should be archived or deleted. Removing or moving the data out of the store will decrease the value of the information
on the database and optimize space.
