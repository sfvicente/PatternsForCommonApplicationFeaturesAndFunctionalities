# Design | Tooltips

Tooltips are small and informative text labels that are normally displayed when a user hovers over an element. They can also be displayed when focus is set on an
element or when the user interacts with it.

Tooltips are used to explain features, provide additional context on functionality or guide a user through a workflow.

### Avoid relying solely on hover as the trigger for displaying tooltip

When tooltips are only shown by hovering over an element, it creates a problem for keyboard users that won't be able to trigger them.

### Always display one tooltip at a time.

If more than one tooltip is shown at a time, it can be distracting, confusing or annoying.

## Workflows
<br>


### Always display a progress indicator in tooltips that are used in workflow guidance.

This allows the user to understand what is the length of the flow, where they are currently at and how many stages remain for completion.
