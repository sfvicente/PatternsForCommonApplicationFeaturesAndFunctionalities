### Avoid a negative tone for validation error messages.

Users are more receptive to positive messages. Avoid using words like incorrect, wrong, failed etc.

For example, in case a user has entered an incorrect credit card number, insted of displaying a message such as:

"You have entered an incorrect credit card number."

You can use a more positive message:

"Please provide a valid credit card number."
