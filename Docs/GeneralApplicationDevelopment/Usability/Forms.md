### Prefer top-left aligned labels to improve readability and decrease form completion time.

UX research performed at Google, discovered that placing labels above form fields and aligned to the left-hand side decreased form completion time. This is due to the reduced
points of fixation.

### Always stack radio button groups vertically.

By stacking radio buttons vertically the user is able to process the information faster to perform choices as compared to an horizontal layout.

### Avoid a negative tone for validation error messages.

Users are more receptive to positive messages. Avoid using words like incorrect, wrong, failed etc.

For example, in case a user has entered an incorrect credit card number, insted of displaying a message such as:

"You have entered an incorrect credit card number."

You can use a more positive message:

"Please provide a valid credit card number."

### Avoid dropdown controls in forms, prefering radio button groups, toggles or steppers.

Forms with dropdowns take more time to complete. Also, selecting items from the dropdown lists is difficult on mobile phones with smaller screens.
