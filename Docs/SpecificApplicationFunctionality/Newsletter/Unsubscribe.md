# Newsletter | Unsubscribe
<br>


## Process
<br>

### Consider having a 1-click unsubscribe process.

From a user's point of view, unscribing from a mailing list should be quick, easy and frictionless.

The optimal experience starts with the user receiving an email sent with a clearly identified 'Unsubscribe' link. After clicking on the link, the user is removed from the list
and redirected to a confirmation page. In this page, the user is notified of the removal in a friendly, positive and professional tone.

By not including mutiple steps, requests for feedback or different options, it makes the process straightforward and keeps the users happy.

## Communication
<br>


### Do not send a confirmation email after removing a the user from an email list.

It is important to send email notifications on important operations and security events pertaining to the account and the user. However, when a user unsubscribes from a mailing
list, they expect the operation to be executed. In this case, users will neither care or appreciate a confirmation.

Sending an email after a user requests a cancelation of a subscription when they don't want to receive anymore emails is not recommended.
