# Newsletter | Unsubscribe
<br>


### Consider having a 1-click unsubscribe process.

From a user's point of view, unscribing from a mailing list should be quick, easy and frictionless.

The optimal experience starts with the user receiving an email sent with a clearly identified 'Unsubscribe' link. After clicking on the link, the user is removed from the list
and redirected to a confirmation page. In this page, the user is notified of the removal in a friendly, positive and professional tone.

By not including mutiple steps, requests for feedback or different options, it makes the process straightforward and keeps the users happy.

### After unsubscribing the user, ask for the reason or feedback.

Possible options are:

	- The emails are inappropriate
	- The emails are spam and should be reported

### Do not send a confirmation email after removing a the user from an email list.

It is important to send email notification on important operations and security events. However, when a user unsubuscribes from a mailing list, they expect the operation
to be executed.

Users either don't care or won't appreciate a confirmation. Sending a confirmation email after a user requests a cancelation so they don't receive anymore emails is not recommended.
