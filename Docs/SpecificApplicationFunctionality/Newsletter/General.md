## Process
<br>


### Consider sending the email newsletters consistently.

This allows for your audience to grow anticipation and increase the open/viewing rate of the email.

For example, if you have a weekly email newsletter, consider sending it to the subscribers on the exact same day and time every week.

## Content
<br>


### Consider using a table of contents

To allow users to efficiently scan the content of the newsletter, consider inserting a table of contents at the top of the email.

One way to construct a table of contents would be to set the titles of each article or section with anchors to link to the appropriate location.

### Consider including only partial articles and link back to the application for the full content.

Newsletters can include articles that are available in the associated web site. In this case, consider keeping the newsletter short by only displaying part of each article and
linking back to the web site. 

In case the articles are short, the full content can be included.
