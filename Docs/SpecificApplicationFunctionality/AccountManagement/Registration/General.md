<br>


### Keep the number of fields required for registration to a minimum.

### Consider asking for information progressively at different steps on points in time.

Instead of asking all the information useful to the application at registration, ask for the data only when necessary. The objective should be to complete
the sign up. If data can be added afterwards, request it at a later point in time.

## Offering

### Always display the offering and the customer benefits on registration.

Similar to the homepage/landing page, the registration should also communicate the value proposition.

When the user is signing up, there should succint information of the offering and the customer benefits. These need to be displayed in a compelling design or structure.

### Consider not forcing people to register but having a guest checkout option.
