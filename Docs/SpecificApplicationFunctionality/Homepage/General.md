## Header Bar
The header bar is a user interface element commonly created as the first section at the top of an application or site. It normally contains the company logo, navigation and a
call-to-action button.
<br>


### Always separate the navigation list of links and the call-to-action links.

It provides a logical separation in terms of areas and makes locating elements such as the call to action much efficiently.

## Offering
<br>


### Always display a headline with a clear and simple message that indicates what is being offered.

You should always assume that people don't know what is being offered. Visitors need to understand what is the offering before they can be persuaded to buy.

On the fold, your application needs to present a message that specifies either what the business does, or what the product or services offers. This message is
called _value proposition_.

// TODO Examples

A _value proposition_ is a statement summarizing why a visitor should purchase the products or use the services. It should explain in a succinct and clear way how
the product or services satisfies a need. It also communicates details about its added benefits while positioning itself superior to existing products or services. Ideally
it should appeal to the customers most pressing needs or biggest factor that could influence the purchase.

### Consider using explanatory videos for the product or service being offered.

can be used. The objective is to increase or accelerate conversion.

### Always include supporting images or videos to generate emotion and drive action.

Images are powerful triggers to drive user action. The objective for images and videos in a home page is to persuade a customer act on your offer.

Never use generic photos or videos from online repositories. Not only can those assets be seen as cheap or repetitive but original and well designed images and 
videos produce more impact.
