## Header Bar
The header bar is a user interface element commonly created as the first section at the top of an application or site. It normally contains the company logo, navigation and a
call-to-action button.
<br>


### Always separate the navigation list of links and the call-to-action links.

It provides a logical separation in terms of areas and makes locating elements such as the call to action much efficiently.
