### Consider not reiterating features from lower tiers in the higher tiers descriptions.

This uses less space and keeps the layout simpler without text duplication.

The following are examples of sentences that can be used to convey the message:
- All the benefits of {lower tier}, and:
- Everything in {lower tier}, plus:

The message stating the inclusion of features does not need to be identical for each tier.

### Consider offering a free plan to obtain feedback from customers, demonstrate the features of the product, test the viability of the offer or perform faster customer acquisition.

One possible issue is product positioning.

### Use charm pricing for individual plans.

Charm pricing, also known as psychological pricing, is a tactic in which price is adjusted to impact consumers psychologically and prompt them to buy.

It is performed by setting odd numbers for prices of products and services. One common example is is ending the sale price with the numbers 9 or 5.
