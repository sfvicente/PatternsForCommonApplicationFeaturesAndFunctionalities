### Consider not reiterating features from lower tiers in the higher tiers descriptions.

This uses less space and keeps the layout simpler without text duplication.

The following are examples of sentences that can be used to convey the message:
- All the benefits of {lower tier}, and:
- Everything in {lower tier}, plus:

The message stating the inclusion of features does not need to be identical for each tier.

### Consider using original or theme related designations for the tier names instead of the common names such as Basic, Standard and Premium.

### Always provide annual subscriptions for each tier in addition to the normal interval.

Pricing for each tier should always be available for both regular tier (monthly for example) and annual subscriptions. Annual subscriptions present important advantages
to a service provider. It garantees immediate income, prevents customer churn for a longer period and provides predicatability in revenue flow.

It's common practice to make annual pre-paid payment cheaper to encourage users to opt for annual plans.

### Use charm pricing for individual plans.

Charm pricing, also known as psychological pricing, is a tactic in which price is adjusted to impact consumers psychologically and prompt them to buy.

It is performed by setting odd numbers for prices of products and services. One common example is is ending the sale price with the numbers 9 or 5.
