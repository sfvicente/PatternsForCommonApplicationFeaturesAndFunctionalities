### Consider using a free trial length of 14 days.

The trial length should be directly related to the complexity of the product. It should be defined taking into account both the time a user needs to setup in order to use it and
the time required to obtain meaningful results from it. The longer it takes to achieve these, the longer free trial duration should be.

For most business, the recommended duration is 14 days. Using 30 days or more, does not provide a sense of urgency for the user to become a paying subscriber. It should be used
when the program is complex or has a difficult learning curve. Some products use free trials with a 7 day duration which might be too limiting depending on the features and usage of the product.
