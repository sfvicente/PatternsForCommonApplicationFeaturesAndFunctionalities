# Offboarding | General
<br>


### Always design the offboarding process as part of the customer journey and as a positive experience.

An offboarding process is part of the customer journey. It should be designed with the objective of leaving a great impression on a customer intending to leave
the platform, product or service. The experience should be a positive and still provide an opportunity to try and retain a customer that is unsure about the 
cancellation.

A good experience when offboarding customers can contribute to them deciding on using the product again in the future. Previous customers are also more inclined
to provide referrals and positive reviews when they had a positive offboarding process.

A decision to stop using a product or service can be a reflection of the product itself. It could have had a decrease in quality, no longer be satisfying a customer's
needs or a competitor might have a better offer. However, there could be various reasons that lead a customer to discontinue the use of a service that are outside
of the product scope. For example, a company could be suffering a financial impact and is cutting down its expenses.

An Offboarding process can include a feedback mechanism as an opportunity to understand why customers are leaving.

### Consider asking the user for feedback when they decide to stop using the product or service.

When a customer stops using a product or service, it's important to understand what led them to that decision. Obtaining more information can help address
those issues in the future and decrease or prevent further cancellations.

### Always provide an option to delete the account.

Users choose to delete their account because as they won’t return to the site in the future, won't use the product anymore or want all their data deleted.

Deleting an account, unlike cancelling a membership or deactivating an account, is a permanent action. It should remove all user data, account details and security information
from the system.

### Always end the relationship on a positive note

After a user chooses to cancel or delete an account, thank them for the membership and show that you are always ready to resume the collaboration.
