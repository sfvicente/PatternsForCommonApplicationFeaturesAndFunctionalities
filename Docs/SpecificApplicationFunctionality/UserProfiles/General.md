# User Profiles | General

User profiles are visual representations of the personal data of an application user. The profiles capture the attributes of an individual user, which can be displayed and
edited afterwards.

Applications and systems use profiles for configuration, recommendations and identification, amongst other functionalities.

### Consider reserving space for a summary section that a user can fill.

A user profile can be built with a configurable element for a summary. It can then be displayed in the public profile page for that user.

Users can take advantage of the space to introduce themselves, describe their qualifications or market their skills. On social websites, this facilitates networking and the
selling of products and services.
