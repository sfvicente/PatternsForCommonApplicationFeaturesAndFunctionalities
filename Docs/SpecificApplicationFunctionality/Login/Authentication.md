### Avoid using SMS for 2FA authentication

An SMS Two Factor Authentication is a security verification mechanism in which a user is sent a text message with a code to their mobile number at the time of login. The user then inputs the
code in the application, thereby completing the verification of their identity at the login process.

Using SMS for 2FA is considered less secure then using an authentication application due to multiple weaknesses.
