### Display the password strength to the user to encourage better security.

When users register their account, the aplication should encourage the creation of a strong password.

Consider displaying the password strength as the user enters the password. This enables the user to view how strong their password is and change it accordingly.

### Display the password policy to allow users to create the right password the first time.

## Offering
<br>


### Always display the offering and the customer benefits on registration.

Similar to the homepage/landing page, the registration should also communicate the value proposition.

When the user is signing up, there should succint information of the offering and the customer benefits. These need to be displayed in a compelling design or structure.

## Guest Checkout

The Guest Checkout is an application feature that allows a visitor to purchase without logging into or creating an account.

### Consider not forcing people to register but having a guest checkout option.
