# Product Listing | General

### Use filters to allow customers to narrow their product listings.

### Consider switching between different product images on hover to give visitors a better view of the product.

On hover, the current product image can be replaced by another image of the same product. This allows you to fit more product information on listing area which
has limited space.

### Consider displaying a product view and a model view if applicable to the product.

The interface can switch the picture to the model view on hover. Displaying a model wearing the product allows the customers to view how it could look.

### When using a product view and model view, consider allowing the customer to customise the default view.

This also helps to personalise the experience.

### Considering allowing customers to view the product in action without leaving the product listing page.

The objective is to complement your value proposition.

### When available, add product ratings to each product item to start establishing social proof.

TODO: description.

<br>


### Consider displaying the number of ratings a product has received.

A product overall rating may be accompanied with the number of times it has been rated. It makes it easier for a customer to understand how popular a product is and how
much weight to put on the rating.

### Consider displaying partial customer testimonials under the product descriptions.

Adding testimonials, even partial ones, can overload a product listing page with content.

### Always display a quick add-to-cart button on each item in the listing.

If each item in a product listing page has a quick add-to-cart button, customers execute orders faster. It also won't require visitors to go into each detail page just to
add the product to the order.

Regarding testing, it allows for experimentation on design and structure of the call-to-action to improve conversions.

### Consider displaying a quick button to choose item characteristics such as size or color before adding the item to cart.

Similar to the quick add-to-cart button, this feature allows a customer to order without going into each detail page.

<br>


### Considering allowing customers to save an item in as a favorite.

A purchase may take more than one session to be completed. An application with functionality to record favorite products allows users to return and purchase those at a later stage.
It may be useful for customers who are browsing available products to build wish lists.

For internal use, it also contributes analytic data that provides insight on customer behavior, product desirability and trends.

### Consider displaying the number of users that have marked a product has favorite.

It can be used to create the feeling of urgency.

### Add persuasion triggers to product images to increase conversions.

### Ensure visitors can see offers such as price deals or discounted items without requiring navigation to the product detail pages.

### For product offers, focus on the savings for customers, instead of only displaying the discounted price.
