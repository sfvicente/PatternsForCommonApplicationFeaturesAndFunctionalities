# Cookies | Consent
<br>


### Consider asking for the cookie consent only when it’s actually required.

In most use cases for the cookie consent mechanism, the notification doesn’t disappear until the user acts on it.

In terms of user experience, if it is displayed as soon as the user arrive on the web site and is not dismissed, it will be displayed when visiting any other section of the website.

However, asking for consent is not required on every page. By asking for the cookie consent only when it’s required consent can be bypassed if no action requiring data storage is performed and the application provides a better user experience.

Typical examples would be when the user is registering an account or needs to update their settings.
