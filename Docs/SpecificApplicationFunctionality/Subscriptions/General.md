Subscriptions are a business model in which a company provides or supports ongoing services/products on a regular basis in exchange for recurring payments by customers.

Adopting a subscription based model has a number of advantages for sellers. Not only will it retain customers for a greater long term value but it also makes
it easier to predict revenue levels and fulfillment needs.
